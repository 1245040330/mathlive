The `examples/` directory contain some ready to use examples using MathLive:
- [`examples/basic/`]{@link https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/examples/basic} 
create a mathfield, read its content when it changes, and outputs it as LaTeX
- [`examples/with_requirejs/`]{@link https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/examples/with_requirejs} 
load the MathLive sources using **require.js**. This is not a recommended 
strategy for deployment, but this can be convenient for debugging or 
making changes to MathLive
