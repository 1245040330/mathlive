## How To Use MathLive

You can use MathLive to simply render math equations by 
[adding a few lines to your web page](USAGE_GUIDE.md). You can also 
incorporate a “math field” to edit math just like you would edit text. With some 
of the more advanced APIs, you can interact with the math field, including 
extracting its content, inserting placeholders and more.
